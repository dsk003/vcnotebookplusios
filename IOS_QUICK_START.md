## ⏱️ 30-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Add iOS App to Firebase (5 minutes)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click ⊕ **Add app** → **iOS**
4. **Bundle ID:** Enter `com.yourcompany.vcnotebook` (or your choice)
5. **App nickname:** "VCNotebook iOS"
6. Click **Register app**
7. **Download** `GoogleService-Info.plist`
8. **Enable Google Sign-In** (should already be enabled from web)

### Step 2: Create Xcode Project (5 minutes)

1. Open Xcode
2. **File** → **New** → **Project**
3. Choose: **iOS** → **App**
4. Settings:
   - **Product Name:** VCNotebook
   - **Interface:** SwiftUI
   - **Language:** Swift
   - **Bundle Identifier:** `com.yourcompany.vcnotebook` (same as Firebase)
5. **Save** to `vcnotebook+iOS/vcnotebook-ios/`

### Step 3: Add GoogleService-Info.plist (2 minutes)

1. Drag `GoogleService-Info.plist` into Xcode project
2. ✅ Check "Copy items if needed"
3. ✅ Make sure target is checked

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)

**Using Swift Package Manager (Recommended):**

1. In Xcode: **File** → **Add Packages...**
2. Add these URLs one by one:

**Firebase:**
```
https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
```
Select: `FirebaseAuth`, `FirebaseCore`

**Supabase:**
```
https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift
```
Select: `Supabase`, `SupabaseStorage`

**Google Sign-In:**
```
https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS
```
Select: `GoogleSignIn`, `GoogleSignInSwift`

3. Click **Add Package** for each

### Step 5: Configure URL Schemes (2 minutes)

1. In Xcode, select your target
2. Go to **Info** tab
3. Expand **URL Types**
4. Click **+** to add new URL type
5. **URL Schemes:** Copy `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` from `GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Example: `com.googleusercontent.apps.123456789-abcdef`

### Step 6: Copy Project Files (5 minutes)

Copy these files from the repository to your Xcode project:

**From** `vcnotebook+iOS/vcnotebook-ios/VCNotebook/` **to your Xcode project:**

1. `Services/SupabaseService.swift` ✅
2. `Utilities/Config.swift` ✅
3. All files from implementation guides (or use the code samples)

**Or simply:**
```bash
cd vcnotebook+iOS
# Copy the entire project structure
cp -r vcnotebook-ios/VCNotebook/* YourXcodeProject/
```

### Step 7: Update Config (2 minutes)

Edit `Config.swift`:

```swift
static let apiBaseURL = "https://your-app.onrender.com"
```

Replace with your actual Render URL.

### Step 8: Implement Views (Use Documentation)

**You have complete Swift code in:**
- `IOS_AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md` - Copy authentication code
- `IOS_NOTES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Copy notes views
- `IOS_PAYMENTS_GUIDE.md` - Copy payment views

**Simply copy the code from the guides into your Xcode project!**

### Step 9: Build and Run (2 minutes)

1. Select **iPhone simulator** (iPhone 15 Pro recommended)
2. Click ▶️ **Run** or press ⌘R
3. Wait for build to complete
4. App should launch in simulator

### Step 10: Test It! (2 minutes)

1. Tap **Sign in with Google**
2. Choose your Google account
3. Create a new note
4. Open your web app
5. ✅ Note should appear on web immediately!

## 📁 File Organization

Your final Xcode project should look like:

```

├── VCNotebookApp.swift           # Main app
├── AppDelegate.swift             # Firebase setup
├── MainTabView.swift             # Tab bar
├── AuthenticationManager.swift   # Auth logic
├── AuthenticationView.swift      # Sign-in UI
├── NotesListView.swift           # Notes list
├── NoteEditorView.swift          # Note editor
├── NoteDetailView.swift          # Note detail

├── Models/
│   ├── Note.swift
│   └── FileAttachment.swift
└── GoogleService-Info.plist      # ✅ Firebase config
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### App crashes on launch?
1. Check `GoogleService-Info.plist` is added correctly
2. View Xcode console for error messages
3. Verify bundle ID matches Firebase

### Sign-in doesn't work?
1. Check URL schemes in Info.plist
2. Verify `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` is correct
3. Make sure Google Sign-In is enabled in Firebase

### Notes don't appear?
1. Check backend is running: Visit `https://your-app.onrender.com/healthz`
2. Open Xcode console - look for API errors
3. Verify user is signed in (check Firebase console)

### Can't see web app's notes on iOS?
1. Make sure using same Google account
2. Pull to refresh on iOS
3. Check user_id in Supabase dashboard matches

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Xcode Previews** - Fast UI iteration
   ```swift
   struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
       static var previews: some View {
           ContentView()
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Print Statements** - Debug with Config.log()
   ```swift
   Config.log("User signed in: \(userId)", type: .success)
   ```

3. **Network Inspector** - See API calls in Xcode console

4. **Hot Reload** - ⌘R to see changes instantly

5. **Simulator** - Much faster than real device for development
