## 🚀 Step-by-Step

### 1️⃣ Create New Xcode Project

```
Open Xcode → Create New Project
├── Choose: iOS > App
├── Product Name: VCNotebook
├── Interface: SwiftUI
├── Language: Swift
└── Save to: /Users/dsk/vcnotebook+iOS/vcnotebook-ios/
```

**Uncheck**: "Create Git repository" ❌

---

### 2️⃣ Delete Default Files

Delete these 2 files Xcode created:
- ❌ `VCNotebookApp.swift`
- ❌ `ContentView.swift`

---

### 3️⃣ Add Your Swift Files

```
Right-click VCNotebook folder → Add Files to VCNotebook
├── Navigate to: /Users/dsk/vcnotebook+iOS/vcnotebook-ios/VCNotebook/
├── Select ALL folders: App, Components, Core, Models, Resources, Services, Utilities
├── Settings:
│   ├── Copy items: ❌ UNCHECKED
│   ├── Create groups: ✅ SELECTED
│   └── Add to targets: ✅ VCNotebook CHECKED
└── Click Add
```

---

### 4️⃣ Add Firebase Config File

**Get the file:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Your Project → ⚙️ Settings → iOS app
3. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`

**Add to Xcode:**
1. Drag `GoogleService-Info.plist` into Resources folder
2. ✅ Check "Copy items if needed"
3. ✅ Check "Add to targets: VCNotebook"

---

### 5️⃣ Add Package Dependencies

**File → Add Package Dependencies** (do this 3 times):

**Package 1: Firebase**
```
URL: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
Version: Up to Next Major 10.0.0
Select: ✅ FirebaseAuth, ✅ FirebaseCore
```

**Package 2: Google Sign-In**
```
URL: https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS
Version: Up to Next Major 7.0.0
Select: ✅ GoogleSignIn
```

**Package 3: Supabase**
```
URL: https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift
Version: Up to Next Major 2.0.0
Select: ✅ Supabase
```

---

### 6️⃣ Configure URL Scheme

**Get REVERSED_CLIENT_ID:**
- Open `GoogleService-Info.plist` in Xcode
- Copy the value of `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID`

**Add to project:**
1. Click VCNotebook project (blue icon)
2. Select VCNotebook target
3. Info tab → URL Types
4. Click **+**
5. Paste `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` in URL Schemes

---

### 7️⃣ Update Backend URL

**Edit Config.swift:**
```swift
// Change this line:
static let apiBaseURL = "https://your-app.onrender.com"

// To your actual URL:
static let apiBaseURL = "https://vcnotebook.onrender.com"
```

Save: `⌘ + S`

---

### 8️⃣ Build and Run!

1. Select simulator: iPhone 15 Pro
2. Click ▶️ Play button (or press `⌘ + R`)
3. Wait for build...
4. App launches in simulator! 🎉

---

## ⚡ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No such module Firebase" | Wait for packages to download, try again |
| Build failed | Clean: `Shift ⌘ + K`, then build: `⌘ + R` |
| Sign-in doesn't work | Check GoogleService-Info.plist and URL Schemes |
| Simulator slow | Use iPhone SE simulator instead |
