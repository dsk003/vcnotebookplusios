```

Change it to your **actual Render URL**. For example:
```swift
static let apiBaseURL = "https://vcnotebook.onrender.com"
```

**How to find your Render URL:**
1. Go to [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)

If you see errors, don't panic! Common issues:

**Error: "No such module 'Firebase'"**
- Solution: Wait for all packages to finish downloading, then try again

**Error: "Failed to register bundle identifier"**
- Solution: In Xcode, go to VCNotebook target ‚Üí Signing & Capabilities ‚Üí change the Bundle Identifier to something unique (e.g., `com.yourname.VCNotebook123`)
